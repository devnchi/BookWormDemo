Equipped with user login, this application will let users add books by title and author, and leaves a section where the user can review the book in-depth with some text. Ideally, other users would be able to visit the user's profile and see their booklist/# of reviews. For now, users can delete and edit/update their reviews.  Cooler features could include a database with enough book titles that users can click on books and actually get data back about them (maybe goodreads API or something).
