# BookWormDemo

I started buliding this application called "Book Worm" this week. This application is built with:

NODE
EXPRESS
MONGODB
PASSPORT

Equipped with user login, this application will let users add books by title and author, and leaves a section where the user can review the book in-depth with some text. Ideally, other users would be able to visit the user's profile and see their booklist/# of reviews. Users could also be able to comment and like the reviews.  Cooler features could include a database with enough book titles that users can click on books and actually get data back about them (maybe goodreads API or something). I was not able to connect to my server to my database so I settled for just a wireframe of what the application is actually supposed to do. This week, I plan on figuring out how to do this in ejs after getting my database up and running.
